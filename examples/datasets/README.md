# OBSR Datasets

Examples showcasing the available datasets from the Open Benchmark for Spatial Representations (OBSR).

## Available prediction tasks

The benchmark tasks are split into two main categories: point-based and trajectory-based.

Below is the list of example tasks:

### Point-based tasks

#### Price prediction

- Short term rental price - Predict the average short-term rental price for a given hexagonal region (at a specified H3 resolution). The task uses region embeddings generated by the evaluated model, optionally combined with additional features from the provided dataset. The benchmark is based on Airbnb data, enabling evaluation of how well spatial representations capture economic patterns in urban areas. (Airbnb)
- House sale price - Predict the average house sale price for a given hexagonal region (at a specified H3 resolution). The task uses region embeddings generated by the evaluated model, optionally combined with property-related features from the provided dataset. The benchmark is based on the House Sales in King County dataset, enabling assessment of how well spatial representations capture real estate market patterns. (House Sales in King County)

#### Activity prediction

- Crime activity prediction - ... (Chicago Crime, Philadelphia Crime, SFPD Incident Report Datatset)

### Trajectory-based tasks

#### Human Mobility Prediction (HMC)

- Auto-regression classification of user trajectories - ... (Geolife, Porto Taxi)

#### Travel Time Estimation (TTE)

- Predict estimated travel time - ... (Geolife, Porto Taxi)

## Contributing new datasets

Datasets codebase in SRAI is based mainly on HuggingFace backend. The library offers preprocessed datasets with predefined train and test splits, as well as "`raw`" version for users to split manually.

Although most of the datasets are based on data from [`Kraina`](https://huggingface.co/kraina) organisation, we are not limited to it. Each dataset class can point to any public dataset on HuggingFace.

We want to collect and distribute vector based datasets for evaluating geospatial embeddings in a variety of tasks. We are using H3 grid system to generate data at different resolutions for the same dataset.

Requirements for a new spatial dataset:

- Publicly available.
- Has a spatial component - points with a target, collection of points that will be agrgegated, trajectories, regions for classification, etc...
- Available train and test splits should be split spatially (there is a `train_test_spatial_split` function available in the `srai.spatial_split` module) - we want to ensure that both splits don't cover the same regions. If the dataset covers multiple cities (like Airbnb), consider splitting the data for each city / region individually and combine the results a the end. Can be omitted in trajectory based tasks - hard to achieve proper separation.
- Should have a default H3 aggregation resolution with an optional list of available other resolutions to test different levels.
- Doesn't violate any licenses (can be Non-Commercial) - for example, `GeoLife` and `Philadelphia Crime` datasets are downloaded from their original sources, and only splits with IDs are saved on HuggingFace, because their licenses don't allow for redistribution. Required processing of raw data is automatically done on the user side with attached code.
