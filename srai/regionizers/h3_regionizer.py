"""
H3 regionizer.

This module exposes Uber's H3 Hexagonal Hierarchical Geospatial Indexing System [1] as a regionizer.

Note:
    The default API [2] was chosen (basic_str) to ease the implementation.
    It may be beneficial to try the NumPy API for computationally-heavy work.

        Buffer geometries to generate H3 cells that cover them entirely.

        Filling the geometries using h3.polygon_to_cells() with H3 cells does
        not cover fully the geometries around the borders, because some H3 cells' centers fall out
        of the geometries. To overcome that a buffering is needed to incorporate these cells back.
        Buffering is done in meters and is liberal, which means that performing
        h3.polygon_to_cells() on new geometries results in some H3 cells not intersecting with the
        original geometries. Spatial join with the original geometries is needed later to solve
        this issue.

        Notes:
            According to [1] the ratio between the biggest and smallest hexagons at a given
            resolution is at maximum ~2. From that we can deduce, that the maximum edge length
            ratio becomes t_max / t_min = sqrt(2). As we would like to buffer at least 1 edge length
            regardless of the size, we need to multiply by at least sqrt(2).
